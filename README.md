# DbUp Demo
DbUp is a .NET library that helps you deploy changes to SQL Server database. It tracks which SQL scripts have been run already, and runs the change scripts that are needed to get your database up to date. There is support for a variety of database platforms, including PostgreSQL. There is a good amount of documentation available at [https://dbup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://dbup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and hopefully this project will show a little bit of what is possible in a form that meets our idioms.
